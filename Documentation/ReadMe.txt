Details about using RothToo RC1 and accessories.

If you want to add your own skin to the skin HUD, see the Notecard "AddingYourOwnSkin".

If you are getting errors when applying skin textures in certain grids or areas of grids, see the Notecard "Skin Applier ERRORs fix".

The Clothing Layers Lower and Upper, and Tattoo Layer FullBody can be copied and edited to use your own clothing/tattoo textures. These use the default Second Life clothing textures UV. The Clothing Upper and Lower layers have one Face to apply your upper/lower texture to it. The Tattoo FullBody layer has 2 faces to apply your textures to, an upper face and a lower face; be sure to select the proper face when applying a texture to the Tattoo FullBody layer. These layers to not cover the hands, feet or head.

All 3 of these mesh Layers should work best when using "Alpha mode" "None" if your texture covers the entire mesh. If you need to have see thru sections, I would suggest using the "Alpha mode" of "Alpha masking"; start with a "Mask cutoff" of 128 and adjust until it looks best to you. If you really can't make "Alpha masking" work, then you can also use "Alpha blending", but that is likely to cause strange appearances when combined with other items, like hair, that also use "Alpha blending".
