ERRORS
Some grids do not allow certain scripting commands which are implemented in RothTooRC1. Below is how to modify RothTooRC1 to prevent those errors.

If you are getting script errors when applying skin textures to the RothTooRC1 Mesh Body, follow these steps to resolve:

Fix if you have access to a sandbox or building area:
1) If you are in or have access to a sandbox or building area, go there.
2) Detach your RothTooRC1 mesh body.
3) Drag your RothTooRC1 mesh body to the ground. (Parts may be invisible if you had any AlphaCuts active when wearing it last; no problem.)
4) Right-click edit your RothTooRC1 mesh body.
5) Go to the "Content" tab of the edit menu.
6) Find the Notecard named "ALLOWALPHAS".
7) Rename that Notecard to anything else, like "DONTALLOWALPHAS"
8) Exit edit mode.
9) Take RothTooRC1 mesh body. (Right-click->Take)
10) Add/Wear mesh body you just edited and test applying skin textures. Those errors should be gone now.

Fix without access to a sandbox or building area:
1) Wear/Add RothTooRC1 mesh body.
2) Within your inventory window, find the body you just Wore/Add. You can do all this within the "Worn" tab to help you find the body you are wearing.
3) Right-click the name of the worn body in Inventory and select "Edit".
    a) This makes sure you are editing the right object.
    b) It is easy to accidentally select one of the clothing/tattoo layers directly.
4) Follow all the above instructions starting at "5)".
5) When done with above instructions, detach body and reattach/Add.
6) Test applying skin textures. Those errors should be gone now.
