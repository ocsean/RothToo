If you are getting errors when applying skin textures, rename this file to anything but "ALLOWALPHAS"; case does not matter. (i.e. rename to "DONTALLOWALPHAS")

You will likely have to also detach and reattach this mesh body, although "Reset Scripts" should also work.

If you are using skins that are PNG format, you may have to edit the mesh body; go to "Texture" tab and set "Alpha mode" to "None" after you apply the skin with this HUD. You can avoid the need reset the Alpha mode by using JPEG format skins.
